    "\n",
    "There are 3 test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case (), the initial height () of the tree remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case (), the tree doubles in height and is  meters tall after the spring cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third case (), the tree doubles its height in spring (, ), then grows a meter in summer (, ), then doubles after the next spring (, ), and grows another meter after summer (, ). Thus, at the end of 4 cycles, its height is  meters."
